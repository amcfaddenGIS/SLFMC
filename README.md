SLFMC: Seasonal Live Fuel Moisture Content. A python package for analyzing seasonal fluctuations of live fuel moisture content through satellite imagery

## **Background**

#### *What is Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC)?*
  LFMC is an estimation of water content within plants. It is expressed as a ratio of water content in fresh plant tissue to its dry weight (Pivovaroff et al. 2019) and is measured by collecting samples of vegetation on the ground. 

#### *Why is it Important?*
  LFMC is a key component for wildfire spread and ignition since moisture reduces the flammability of vegetation, subsequently lowering the possibility of wildfire progression (Pivovaroff et al. 2019). For ignition to occur, vegetation must reach a critical fuel moisture threshold. For the graph provided by Pivovaroff et al., LFMC exhibits a seasonal trend due to variations in precipitation. During the Summer and Fall, precipitation decreases in southern California and LFMC of chaparral (vegetation) reaches its critical threshold for ignition, increasing fire risk. 


#### *How do we effectively estimate it through Remote Sensing?*
